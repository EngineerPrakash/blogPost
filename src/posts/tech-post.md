Here are a few defaults I reach for when spinning up a new side project:

- Minimal tooling first — add complexity only when needed.
- Fast feedback loops — instant preview and quick deploys.
- Good defaults for accessibility and performance.
- Simple content model — Markdown and folders over databases.

I’ll iterate on each area in future posts.
